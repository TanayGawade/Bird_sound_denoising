Bird Sound Denoising Using Residual Blocks in a U-Net Architecture

ðŸ“Œ Overview

This project focuses on building an **image segmentation model** using PyTorch, designed to denoise bird sound spectrograms. The model is trained on a custom bird sound dataset, leveraging residual blocks within a U-Net architecture to improve denoising performance.

The research is inspired by:
